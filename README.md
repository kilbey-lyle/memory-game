## UX

### Project Goals
The goal of 'Click It!' is to create a simple game for all ages. Pitting friends and family against each other to try reach the highest score without making a single mistake. Click it will contain easy to use share features to allows users to to brag about their superior memory via social media and email. The inbuilt competition CLick It! provides, combines for the perfect blend of fun and frustration. 

### Player Goals
A player will be motivated to visit Click It! to show their short-term memory prowess, wether attempting to best themselves or a peer. To a player their goal is simple, enjoy attempting to get the highest possible sequence in an environment with a ever increasing level of complexity. 

### Developer and Business Goals
Build a simple single-player memory game. Using available social media and email API's to allow users to quickly and easily share their score from each round attempted.
